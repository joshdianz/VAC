              VAC (Voice of Africans for Change) is a community-based non-profit
              organization registered with the Department of Social Development.
              It seeks to protect and promote the rights of asylum seekers,
              refugees and immigrants in South Africa. Linked to that, VAC seeks
              to promote a holistic integration approach to lessen incidences of
              conflicts related to xenophobia.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              VAC was founded in 2012 as a response to a growing trend of human
              rights violations towards refugees and asylum seekers on the one
              hand, and a need to establish structures capable of providing
              professional educational support to children of immigrants on the
              other hand. In addition to that, threats of a possible xenophobic
              violence outbreak made it necessary to maintain vigilance through
              monitoring and interventions where possible. The aim was to
              pre-empty such attacks as opposed to post-violence intervention
              which is what civil society organizations are known to do.

              Voice of Africans for Change (VAC) is a non-governmental
              organisation working with communities, government and other civil
              society formations on issues of refugee rights in South Africa.
              While asylum-seekers and refugees have rights established in
              international conventions and South African law, these are often
              violated in practice. VAC engages this challenge by working with
              South Africans as well as foreign-born residents to build bridges,
              especially at the grassroots level.

              We seek to promote greater understanding, tolerance and a
              collective approach to grassroots issues. VAC believes in our
              common humanity, shared African heritage and the rights of all, to
              dignified treatment as enshrined in the various international
              rights conventions of which South Africa is a signatory. These
              values are also embedded in the South African Bill of Rights and
              the national constitution.
