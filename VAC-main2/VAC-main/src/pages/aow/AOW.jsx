              Rights advocacy is primarily about informing, educating, and
              engaging local communities about asylum-seeker and refugee rights
              through workshops, social events like soccer tournaments, and
              engagements with stakeholders like Home Affairs and the local
              SAPS.

              Where it assists in community-level work, VAC engages government
              institutions, especially SAPS, and the departments of Home
              Affairs, Education, and Health around issues of administration,
              corruption, and upholding human dignity.VAC engages the public
              through the media in favour of refugee rights in particular and
              common humanity in general.
